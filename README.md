# nos-sveu16-mod

## Overview

This project was done as part of our Advanced Operating Systems coursework,
based on a fork of the existing work of our teacher - the SVEU16 CPU emulator
and accompanying operating system ForthOS. The goal of this fork was to
implement a myriad of new features, as well as improving the existing
performance of the system and ensuring a better development experience.

## Features

### New Emulator Features

1. **Improved Interpretation Method**: Exchanged basic interpretation for
   directly threaded interpretation, sacrificing a bit of startup time for
   massive improvements in runtime performance.
2. **Modified Instruction Set Behavior**: Modified existing instruction set to
   accommodate for I/O virtualization and the new video display system.
3. **16-Segment Display Adaptation**: Adapted the existing emulator GUI display
   for the new 16-segment display video system.
4. **Peripheral I/O Virtualization**: Added support for virtualizing peripheral
   I/O systems, allowing for deeper integration with hardware.

### New Operating System Features

1. **Bootstrap Loader**: Implemented a bootstrap sequence using the new
   interface provided by a previously mentioned modification to the instruction
   set, such that the OS can load itself into memory instead of directly loading
   the entire OS into memory through the emulator.
2. **16-Segment Display System**: Changed previous ASCII raster-based display to
   a 16-segment display system, reducing memory usage and simplifying character
   encoding.

## Getting Started

This implementation of the SVEU16 emulator is designed using the Windows API,
requiring cross-compilation for developers using a POSIX environment. We
recommend reading up on the basics of Windows API before getting into this
codebase. The operating system itself is written in the 16-word instruction set
of the SVEU16 CPU. A general understanding of RISC is enough to understand this
component.

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: GCC, Clang, or MinGW for cross-compilation.
- **Build System**: Make.
- **Host OS**: Windows or a POSIX system with compatibility layer (we recommend
  [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/)).

### Installation:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:zlendo1/nos-sveu16-mod.git
   cd nos-sveu16-mod
   ```
2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```
3. **Run the Emulator**:
   ```bash
   ./emulgui.exe
   ```
   Or if you use a POSIX-compliant operating system:
   ```bash
   wine emulgui.exe
   ```

### Usage

- **Emulator**: Use the emulator to run the OS and interact with the OS and its
  systems.
- **Operating System**: Boot the OS through the emulator and explore its new
  features.
